# Supermarket-Analysis
- Exploratory Data Analysis on Product Sale and Plot Visualization.
- Data Cleaning Process in Jupyter Notebook  ,In this project, we'll be analyzing a dataset and then communicate findings about it. we'll be using Python Language to       Clean data and form the tables.
## Python Libraries used in project:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
## CONTENT:
- 1)Introduction to Data : The dataset contains 1000 records distrbuted in 17 columns.
- 2)Null Value and Reduction : There is 0 Null Values , So the Data is Clean and no null values are present.
- 3)Statistical Information : Correlation, Covariance, & Standard Deviation.
- 4)Statistical Figures : Mean, Median and Mode.
- 5)Category Counting : Counting the Values (Product, Product Category, Sub Category)
- 6)Pivot Tables : Genderwise products unit price sold on that date.
- 7)Cross Tabs : It helps us to make informed decisions regarding your research by identifying patterns, trends, and the correlation between your study parameters.
- 8)Strip Plot : A strip plot is very simple to understand. It is basically a scatter plot that differentiates different categories.
- 9)Line Plot : Line Plots depict the relationship between continuous as well as categorical values in a continuous data point format.
- 10)Categorical Plot[Catplot] : In the plot it shows the product categorical wise profit in the catplot and there is two outlier occurs in the given dataset.
- 11)Heat Map : Heat Maps is to better visualize the volume of locations/events within a dataset and assist in directing viewers towards areas on data visualizations          that matter most.
- 12)Box Plot : A bar chart or bar graph is a chart or graph that presents categorical data with rectangular bars with heights or lengths proportional to the values that      they represent
- 13)KDE Plot : Kdeplot is a Kernel Distribution Estimation Plot which depicts the probability density function of the continuous or non-parametric data variables
- 14)Pie Plot : Pie chart show the distribution of the product category.
- 15)Product Analysis According to thier Category
## Conclusion:
  - customer shows less interest in membership in some city on another we observe good support to membership customer           type.
  - Fashion accessories has growth in product line and health and beauty trails the range of product.
